Kaggle-Titanic-Dataset

Solution to Kaggle's Titanic Dataset using various ML algorithms The goal is to
predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on 12 feature such as
sex, age, etc.


**Software and Libraries**

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.8
- Anacoda IDE
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- sklearn
- Jupyter


**Problem Statement**: This is a binary classification to detect the survival or death
of a passenger onboard the Titanic. The model predicts predicts the death or
survival of a new passenger.

**Introduction:**
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of 15 April
1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were
an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest
commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time
it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. It was
built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.
Dataset:
The Titanic dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website which provides separate train and test data.
The train data consists of 891 entries and the test data 418 entries. It has a total of 12 features.

**_Dataset:_**
The Titanic dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website which provides separate train and test data.
The train data consists of 891 entries and the test data 418 entries. It has a total of 12 features.
Exploratory data analysis:
As in different data projects, we'll first start diving into the data and build up our first intuitions. In this section,
we'll be doing four things.
Data extraction: We'll load the dataset and have a first look at it.
Cleaning: We'll fill in missing values.
Plotting: We'll create some interesting charts that'll (hopefully) spot correlations and hidden insights out of the
data

3 survived and mostly all in 1 survived_**
